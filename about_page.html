<div class="about_d2">

<p>Welcome to my universe of artistic KickClick photography, As a photographer 
    I want my photos to imagine a bold, exciting world- one in which the subject, be it a product or a person, stands out, shines. 
    Viewers need to be transported, and my photos achieve that through careful compositions of color and tone. 
    This is the end result of a process by which I bring the creative brief to life and make the subject part of a story
    This is the power that photography's always had for me recognized it when I took my first photo class, I apprenticed with photographers and 
    shot for a variety of publications.  
    To each project I bring my experience and my keen eye</p>
